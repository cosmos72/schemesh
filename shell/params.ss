;; analogous to Chez Scheme (make-parameter), with two differences - see below
;;
;; full behavior:
;;   (make-job-parameter current-value) creates and returns a global parameter,
;;   i.e. a closure that captures a reference to current-value and behaves as follows:
;;     (parameter)           returns current-value
;;     (parameter new-value) sets captured current-value to new-value and returns it.
;;                           further calls to (parameter) will return updated current value.
;;
;;   (make-job-parameter changer) creates and returns a global parameter,
;;   i.e. a closure that captures a reference to current-value and behaves as follows:
;;     (parameter)           returns current value
;;     (parameter new-value) calls (changer current-value new-value),
;;                           then sets captured current-value to the object returned by (changer ...)
;;                           and finally returns updated current-value.
;;                           further calls to (parameter) will return updated current value.
;;
;; differences from Chez Scheme (make-parameter):
;; 1. changer-proc receives both current value and the new value to set,
;; 2. calling (parameter new-value) returns the value actually set.
