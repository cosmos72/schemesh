;;   0                    => return (void)
;;   1..255               => return (failed  wait-status)
;;   256 + kill_signal    => return (killed  signal-name)
;;   512 + stop_signal    => return (stopped signal-name)
;;   768                  => return (running)
;;   > 768                => return (failed  (fx- wait-status 512))
