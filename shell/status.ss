;;   if kind is 'running   -> result is #f or job-id
;;   if kind is 'ok        -> result ... is a list of arbitrary Scheme values
;;   if kind is 'failed    -> result is an 8-bit C exit status or an arbitrary Scheme value
;;   if kind is 'stopped   -> result is signal-name represented as a symbol
;;   if kind is 'killed    -> result is signal-name represented as a symbol
;;   if kind is 'exception -> result is a Scheme condition object
