# schemesh shell job redirection

Shell jobs are implemented by library `(schemesh shell job)` which is also included in `(schemesh shell)` and `(schemesh)`.

Shell syntax to create and redirect shell jobs is the same as POSIX shells,
and differences are documented in the main [README.md](../../README.md).

Scheme functions to **create** shell jobs are not documented yet.

Scheme functions to manage the **environment variables** of existing shell jobs are documented in [env.md](env.md)

Scheme functions to **redirect** existing shell jobs, and to access redirected file descriptors of a Scheme job, are documented below.

### Jobs redirections

Each job created by schemesh has its own environment variables, redirections and current directory.

When a new job is created, it *references* the environment variables, redirections, and current directory of its parent job.
Note: the main schemesh process acts the default parent job if none is specified.

This means that by default, changing the environment variables, redirections or current directory of a parent job also affects all its children jobs.

To stop such sharing, just redirect a job's file descriptor: the new redirection shadows the inherited one, and such redirection is no longer shared.
The same applies for environment variables and current directory: if you set some of them, they shadow inherited values.

### Run a job with redirections

The two functions `(sh-run/bytevector)` and `(sh-run/string)` documented below
add redirections to an existing job, then start the job in foreground,
wait for it to finish, and finally return the output produced by the job.

In this case, the added redirections are *temporary* i.e. they are automatically removed when the job finishes.

##### (sh-run/bytevector)
`(sh-run/bytevector job)` or `(sh-run/bytevector job options)` starts a job in foreground and waits for it to exit.<br/>
Does NOT return early if job is stopped, use `(sh-run/i)` for that. Options are the same as `(sh-start)`.<br/>
Reads job's standard output and returns it converted to bytevector.<br/>
Note: if job finishes with a status `(exception ...)` `(killed 'sigint)` `(killed 'sigquit)` tries to kill `(sh-current-job)` then raises exception.

Optional argument `options` is described in `(sh-start)` and defaults to the empty list.

##### (sh-run/string)
`(sh-run/string job)` or `(sh-run/string job options)` same as [`(sh-run/bytevector)`](#sh-runbytevector), except that job's output is converted to a string:<br/>
starts a job in foreground and waits for it to exit.<br/>
Does NOT return early if job is stopped, use `(sh-run/i)` for that. Options are the same as `(sh-start)`.<br/>
Reads job's standard output and returns it converted to string.<br/>
Note: if job finishes with a status `(exception ...)` `(killed 'sigint)` `(killed 'sigquit)` tries to kill `(sh-current-job)` then raises exception.

Optional argument `options` is described in `(sh-start)` and defaults to the empty list.

### Start a job with redirections

The following functions add redirections to an existing job, start the job in background,
return *immediately* without waiting for the job to finish,
and return ports or file descriptors connected to the started job.

The returned ports or file descriptors must be explicitly closed when no longer needed,
because each one consumes an OS-level file descriptor.

The added redirections are *temporary* i.e. they are automatically removed when the job finishes.

##### (sh-start/fd-stdout)
`(sh-start/fd-stdout job)` or `(sh-start/fd-stdout job options)` starts a job in background, returns a file descriptor fixnum<br/>
for reading job's standard output - for example with `(open-fd-input-port fd)` or `(fd-read-some fd bytevector)`.

Optional argument `options` is described in `(sh-start)` and defaults to the empty list.

Returned file descriptor must be closed with `(fd-close)` when no longer needed.

##### (sh-start/ports)
`(sh-start/ports job [redirections [transcoder-sym [buffer-mode [options]]]]))` starts a job in background,<br/>
returns a list of binary or textual ports connected to the job.<br/>

Again, each returned port must be explicitly closed when no longer needed, because it consumes an OS-level file descriptor.

Optional arguments are:
* `redirections` a property list i.e. an even-sized list containing zero or more redirections.
  Each redirection is a file descriptor fixnum followed by a direction symbol `'<&` `'>&` or `'<>&`.
  Examples:

  `'(1 >&)` redirect job's standard output i.e. file descriptor `1` to write to a pipe.
     The function will return a list containing one element: the read side of such pipe, converted to an input port.

  `'(0 <& 1 >& 2 >&)`
     redirect job's standard input i.e. file descriptor `0` to read from a pipe,
     redirect job's standard output i.e. file descriptor `1` to write to a pipe,
     redirect job's standard error i.e. file descriptor `2` to write to a pipe.
     this is also the default if redirections are not specified.
     The function will return a list containing three element: the other side of such pipes, appropriately converted to input or output ports.

  `'(0 <& 17 <>&)`
     redirect job's file descriptors 0 to read from a pipe, and file descriptor `17` to read and write from a socketpair.
     The function will return a list containing two elements: the write side of job's file descriptor `0`, converted to output port,
     and the socketpair connected to job's file descriptor `17`, converted to input/output port.

* `transcoder-sym` must be one of: `'binary` `'text` or `'utf8b`.<br/>
  If `'binary`, returned ports will be binary.<br/>
  In all other cases - not specified or one of `'text` `'utf8b` - returned ports will be textual
  and will use UTF-8b for converting between bytes and characters.

* `buffer-mode` must be a valid port buffer-mode, i.e. one of `'block` `'line` or `'none`.<br/>
  If not specified, defaults to `'block`.<br/>
  The usual Scheme convention applies: we recommend writing it as one of `(buffer-mode block)` `(buffer-mode line)` `(buffer-mode none)`
  as they better describe the meaning and check for validity at compile-time.

* `options` is described in `(sh-start)` and defaults to the empty list.

##### (sh-start/fds)
`(sh-start/fds job [redirections [options]])` is a lower-level alternative to [`(sh-start/ports)`](#sh-startports):<br>
starts a job in background, returns a list of file descriptors connected to the job.<br/>

Optional arguments are:
* `redirections` is described in [`(sh-start/ports)`](#sh-startports) above and again defaults to `'(0 <& 1 >& 2 >&)`
* `options` is described in `(sh-start)` and defaults to the empty list.

Each returned file descriptor must be closed with `(fd-close)` when no longer needed,
because each one consumes an OS-level file descriptor.


### Redirect a job without starting it

The following functions add redirections to an existing job, without starting it.

The added redirections are *permanent* i.e. they are not automatically removed when the job finishes.

##### (sh-redirect)
`(sh-redirect job dir to [more-redirections ...])` or `(sh-redirect job fd dir to [more-redirections ...])`
redirect file descriptor `fd` of specified job to read from and/or write to specified destination `to`.

This function should be called before starting a job, or after it has finished.<br/>
Calling it on a running or stopped job is guaranteed to affect *future* executions of the same job,<br/>
but may or *may not* affect job's *current* execution.

Optional arguments are:
* `fd` is the job's file descriptor to redirect, must be an unsigned fixnum.<br/>
   If not specified, defaults to `0` if `dir` is `'<` or `'<&` otherwise defaults to `1`.
* `more-redirections` optional further redirections, must be a sequence containing
   zero or more pairs `dir to` and/or triplets `fd dir to`.
   Specifying some redirections as pairs and some as triplets is allowed.

Mandatory arguments are:
* `job` the job to redirect
* `dir` indicates whether the redirection is for reading, writing, or both
   and whether the destination is a file or a file descriptor.<br/>
   It must be one of the symbols:
   * `'<`  read from file
   * `'>`  write to file, truncating it if it exists
   * `'>>` write to file, appending to it if it exists
   * `'<>` read/write from start of file and do NOT truncate it
   * `'<&` read from another file descriptor: `fd` fd will become a copy of file descriptor `to`
   * `'>&` write to another file descriptor: `fd` fd will become a copy of file descriptor `to`
* `to` is the destination. It must be one of:
   * `-1` indicates to close `fd` in child job
   * an unsigned fixnum: the file descriptor to make a copy of
   * a bytevector or a string, indicating the file path to read/write
   * a function accepting zero or one argument, and returning one of the cases above:<br/>
     `-1`, an unsigned fixnum, a bytevector, or a string.<br/>
     The function will be called each time the job is started (passing the job itself as only argument if accepted),<br/>
     and each invocation can also return a different value.

Note: redirections are applied in order, thus later redirections (or later calls to `(sh-redirect)`) can overwrite earlier ones.


### Access redirected ports or file descriptors

As described in the main [README.md](../../README.md#scheme-jobs), Scheme jobs are wrappers around arbitrary Scheme code and are treated as jobs:<br/>
their file descriptors can be redirected with the usual shell syntax, or with the functions above.<br/>
They can be stopped and resumed, they can be used in a pipeline, etc.<br/>

The syntax for creating a Scheme jobs is trivial: just prefix `$` to any parenthesized Scheme expression or declaration. Examples:
```lisp
$(display "hello\n") > greet.txt

$(display
  (let %fib ((i 10))
     (if (fx>? i 2)
       (fx+ (%fib (fx1- i))
            (%fib (fx- i 2)))
       1))) | cat
```

Inside a Scheme job, the standard ports `(current-input-port)` `(current-output-port)` `(current-error-port)` and,
more in general, `(sh-port N)` automatically honor redirections:<br/>
in the examples above, `$(display "hello\n") > greet.txt` writes to the file `greet.txt` in current directory<br/>
and `$(display (let %fib ...)) | cat` writes the 10th Fibonacci number to the pipe connected to `cat`.

If you prefer binary ports, you can use `(sh-stdin)` `(sh-stdout)` and `(sh-stderr)` or, more in general, `(sh-port #f N 'binary)`.

If you want OS-level file descriptors, there's also `(sh-fd 0)` `(sh-fd 1)` and `(sh-fd 2)` or, more in general, `(sh-fd N)`.

If you want the ports or OS-level file descriptors of some other job (i.e. not the current job),
use `(sh-port job-or-id N [transcoder-sym])` or `(sh-fd job-or-id fd)`.

##### (sh-port)
`(sh-port fd)` or `(sh-port job-or-id fd)` or `(sh-port job-or-id fd transcoder-sym)` returns the port
corresponding to file descriptor `fd` for specified `job-or-id`, or for current job if `job-or-id` is not specified or is `#f`.

If `transcoder-sym` is `'binary`, the returned port is a binary port.
In all other cases - not specified or one of `'text` `'utf8b` - the returned port is textual
and uses UTF-8b for converting between bytes and characters.

Ports returned by this function are always buffered - they use `(buffer-mode block)` -
and are closed automatically when the corresponding job finishes.

##### (current-input-port)
If not set to a different value, `(current-input-port)` returns a wrapper port that reads from/writes to the textual port
corresponding to file descriptor `0` for current job.
It is logically equivalent to `(sh-port #f 0 'text)`, although it may return a different port.

##### (current-output-port)
If not set to a different value, `(current-output-port)` returns a wrapper port that reads from/writes to the textual port
corresponding to file descriptor `1` for current job.
It is logically equivalent to `(sh-port #f 1 'text)`, although it may return a different port.

##### (current-error-port)
If not set to a different value, `(current-error-port)` returns a wrapper port that reads from/writes to the textual port
corresponding to file descriptor `2` for current job.
It is logically equivalent to `(sh-port #f 2 'text)`, although it may return a different port.

##### (sh-stdin)
`(sh-stdin)` returns the binary port corresponding to file descriptor `0` for current job.
It returns the same port as `(sh-port #f 0 'binary)`.

##### (sh-stdout)
`(sh-stdout)` returns the binary port corresponding to file descriptor `1` for current job.
It returns the same port as `(sh-port #f 1 'binary)`.

##### (sh-stderr)
`(sh-stderr)` returns the binary port corresponding to file descriptor `2` for current job.
It returns the same port as `(sh-port #f 2 'binary)`.

##### (sh-fd)
`(sh-fd fd)` or `(sh-fd job-or-id fd)` returns the OS-level file descriptor corresponding to `fd` for specified `job-or-id`,
or for current job if `job-or-id` is not specified or is `#f`.

File descriptors returned by this function are closed automatically when the corresponding job finishes.
