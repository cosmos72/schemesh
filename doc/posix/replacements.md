# schemesh posix replacements

The library `(schemesh posix replacements)`, which is also included in `(schemesh rnrs)` and `(schemesh)`,
exports improved version of several standard Scheme functions defined by R6RS.

Such functions are intentionally *not* exported by library `(schemesh posix)`
to avoid conflicts with standard library `(rnrs)`.

Additional filesystem-related functions are also provided by `(schemesh posix dir)`, see [dir.md](dir.md).
