;; define all the thread-related bindings present in Chez Scheme 10.0.0 with threads
;; also on older versions and also on non-threaded builds,
;;
;; plus improved Chez Scheme functions:
;;  (fork-thread) also sets the new thread's thread-local parameters to values returned by (thread-initial-bindings)
;;  (thread-join) also accepts an optional timeout and is interruptible
;;
;; plus a subset of SRFI 18 multithreading functions:
;;  (current-thread) (make-thread) (thread-name) (thread-specific) (thread-specific-set!)
;;  (thread-sleep!) (thread-start!) (thread-terminate!) (thread-yield!)
;;
;; plus some useful extra functions
;;  (thread) (thread-alive?) (thread-count) (thread-find) (thread-id) (thread-initial-bindings)
;;  (thread-stop!) (threads) (threads-status) (threads-status-changes)
