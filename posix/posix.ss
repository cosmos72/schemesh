#!r6rs

;; define (schemesh posix) as a library that exports all its imported bindings
(library-reexport (schemesh posix (0 9 2))
  (import
    (schemesh posix fd)
    (schemesh posix dir)
    (schemesh posix io)
    (schemesh posix pattern)

    ;; by default, do not re-export bindings from (schemesh posix replacements) or (schemesh posix thread)
    ;; because they intentionally conflict with R6RS functions (file-exists?) (delete-file)
    ;; (get-char) (get-datum) (get-line) (get-string-all) (get-string-n) (get-string-some)
    ;; and with Chez Scheme functions for accessing the filesystem and managing threads.
    ;;
    ;; Reason for the conflict: the functions in (schemesh posix replacements)
    ;; are intended as replacements for the default ones, and they add UTF-8b support.
    ;;
    ;; If a user wants them, they need to (import (schemesh posix replacements)) or (import (schemesh))
